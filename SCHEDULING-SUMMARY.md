# Test Scheduling Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What's Been Completed:

### 1. Database Schema ✅
- Added `start_time DATETIME` column to tests table
- Added `end_time DATETIME` column to tests table
- Schema verified and working

### 2. Database Functions ✅
- Updated `createTest()` to accept start_time and end_time parameters
- Created `getTestsWithStatus()` function that calculates test status in real-time
- Status logic: scheduled → live → ended → available

### 3. Backend API ✅
- Updated `createTestInitHandler` to extract and pass scheduling data
- Ready to receive start_time and end_time from frontend

### 4. Documentation ✅
- Created comprehensive implementation guide (TEST-SCHEDULING-IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- Includes all code snippets needed for manual edits

## ⏳ What Needs Manual Editing:

### File 1: `src/views/create-test.ejs`

**Edit 1 - Add Scheduling UI (Line ~256)**
Add the scheduling section with datetime-local inputs for start and end times.
See TEST-SCHEDULING-IMPLEMENTATION.md for exact HTML code.

**Edit 2 - Update Form Submission (Line ~552)**
Add start_time and end_time to the testData object:
```javascript
start_time: document.getElementById('startTime').value || null,
end_time: document.getElementById('endTime').value || null
```

### File 2: `src/controllers/studentCornerController.ts`

**Import and use the new function:**
```typescript
import { getTestsWithStatus } from '../database';
// Replace getAllTests() with:
const tests = await getTestsWithStatus();
```

### File 3: `src/views/student-corner.ejs` (or test list view)

**Add status badges and conditional button logic**
See TEST-SCHEDULING-IMPLEMENTATION.md for complete HTML/EJS code.

## 🎯 How It Works:

```
Teacher Creates Test
        ↓
Sets Start Time: 2025-10-03 20:00:00
Sets End Time:   2025-10-03 22:00:00
        ↓
Saved to Database
        ↓
Student Views Dashboard
        ↓
Current Time Checked Against Schedule
        ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Before 20:00 → "Scheduled" (locked) │
│ 20:00-22:00  → "Live" (enabled)     │
│ After 22:00  → "Ended" (locked)     │
│ No schedule  → "Available" (enabled)│
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🧪 Quick Test Scenario:

1. **Create test** with:
   - Start: Today at 8:00 PM
   - End: Today at 10:00 PM

2. **Before 8 PM:**
   - Badge: 🟡 Scheduled
   - Button: 🔒 Not Yet Available (disabled)

3. **8 PM - 10 PM:**
   - Badge: 🟢 Live Now (pulsing)
   - Button: ▶️ Start Test (enabled, highlighted)

4. **After 10 PM:**
   - Badge: 🔴 Ended
   - Button: ❌ Test Ended (disabled)

---

## 📋 Next Steps:

1. Open `src/views/create-test.ejs` in your editor
2. Find line 256 (after the duration/date section)
3. Copy the scheduling HTML from TEST-SCHEDULING-IMPLEMENTATION.md
4. Paste it in
5. Find the form submission JavaScript (line ~552)
6. Add start_time and end_time to testData
7. Update student dashboard files as documented
8. Rebuild: `npm run build`
9. Test locally
10. Deploy to Vercel

## 💡 Features Included:

✅ Optional scheduling (tests can be immediate or scheduled)
✅ Visual status badges (Scheduled/Live/Ended/Available)
✅ Conditional button enabling based on time

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy!

Once you make the manual edits, the feature will be fully functional. The database and backend are already prepared and waiting for the frontend changes.
